## Project overview

RAG Evaluation System — a TypeScript library + Convex backend + Next.js frontend for evaluating RAG retrieval pipelines. Uses span-based (character-level) evaluation with character span matching for precise retrieval assessment, synthetic question generation, and LangSmith integration for experiment tracking and comparison.

## Key commands

```bash
# From repo root (convenience scripts delegate to packages)
pnpm build              # Build eval-lib with tsup (outputs to packages/eval-lib/dist/)
pnpm test               # Run vitest tests in eval-lib
pnpm typecheck          # TypeScript check eval-lib
pnpm dev                # Start frontend Next.js dev server
pnpm dev:backend        # Start Convex dev server (watches + hot-deploys)
pnpm deploy:backend     # Deploy Convex to production
pnpm typecheck:backend  # TypeScript check backend

# Or run directly in packages
pnpm -C packages/eval-lib build
pnpm -C packages/eval-lib test
pnpm -C packages/backend test      # Run convex-test integration tests
pnpm -C packages/frontend dev
pnpm -C packages/frontend build    # Production build (good for verifying TypeScript)

# One-shot Convex deploy (useful for CI or quick verification)
cd packages/backend && npx convex dev --once
```

## Development workflow

After changing library code in `packages/eval-lib/src/`:
1. `pnpm build` at project root (rebuilds eval-lib dist/)
2. Restart the Next.js dev server (Turbopack caches resolved modules)

Backend changes in `packages/backend/convex/` are automatically picked up by `pnpm dev:backend`.

First-time setup:
```bash
pnpm install          # Run at repo root — links all workspace packages
pnpm build            # Build the eval-lib so frontend and backend can resolve imports
cp packages/frontend/.env.example packages/frontend/.env  # Then fill in values
pnpm dev:backend      # First run: creates Convex project, deploys schema
pnpm dev              # Start frontend
```

## Environment

See `packages/frontend/.env.example` for all frontend env vars and `packages/backend/.env.example` for backend.

Key variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` — Convex deployment URL (from `npx convex dev`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` — Clerk auth keys
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Required in both frontend `.env` and Convex dashboard env vars
- `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` — Required for experiment execution (set in Convex dashboard env vars)

Node >= 18, pnpm for package management, TypeScript strict mode, ESM (`"type": "module"`).

## Architecture notes

### Evaluation approach

The system uses span-based (character-level) evaluation exclusively:
- Ground truth is specified as `CharacterSpan[]` with exact text positions in source documents
- Metrics (`recall`, `precision`, `iou`, `f1`) measure character-level overlap
- `PositionAwareChunker` interface required for chunkers that participate in evaluation

### Synthetic data generation

Three strategies, selectable from the frontend:

- **SimpleStrategy**: Prompt-based. Generates N questions per document.
- **DimensionDrivenStrategy**: Structured diversity. Pipeline: load dimensions → pairwise filter combinations → summarize docs → build relevance matrix → stratified sample → batch generate per document.
- **RealWorldGroundedStrategy**: Matches real-world questions to documents using embedding similarity.

All strategies produce `GeneratedQuery[]`, which are then passed to the `GroundTruthAssigner` to create labeled evaluation data with character spans.

### Experiment execution

Experiments run via LangSmith's native `evaluate()` API:
1. `experiments.orchestration.start` mutation creates experiment record, enqueues `runExperiment` action via WorkPool
2. `runExperiment` (single Convex action in `experiments/actions.ts`) handles the full pipeline:
   - Ensures KB is indexed (skips if chunks already exist)
   - Ensures dataset is synced to LangSmith (delegates to `langsmith.sync.syncDataset` action)
   - Creates a `CallbackRetriever` (eval-lib) backed by Convex vector search
   - Calls `runLangSmithExperiment()` with `onResult` callback that writes per-question results to Convex
   - Aggregates scores and marks experiment complete
3. Results appear in both Convex (real-time UI) and LangSmith (comparison/analytics)

Key eval-lib types for experiment integration:
- `CallbackRetriever` — implements `Retriever` interface via user-provided callbacks (allows Convex to plug in its vector search without eval-lib knowing Convex details)
- `ExperimentResult` — `{ query, retrievedSpans, scores }` emitted per question via `onResult`

### Backend (Convex)

- **Directory structure**: `convex/` is organized into domain directories: `crud/` (CRUD operations), `generation/` (question generation), `retrieval/` (indexing + retrieval), `experiments/` (evaluation), `langsmith/` (sync), `lib/` (shared helpers). Convex uses file-based routing, so `convex/crud/users.ts` → `api.crud.users.functionName` and `internal.crud.users.functionName`.
- **Auth**: Clerk JWT with org-scoped access. Every public function calls `getAuthContext(ctx)` to extract userId/orgId. User records synced via `users.getOrCreate`.
- **Job pipeline**: Long-running operations (question generation, indexing) use WorkPool (`@convex-dev/workpool`) with per-item callbacks, selective cancellation via stored `workIds`, and status transitions. Experiment execution uses a single WorkPool action (no batch processor).
- **RAG**: Position-aware chunking (RecursiveCharacterChunker) + OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small, 1536 dims) + Convex vector search. Chunks store character offsets for direct metric compatibility. Vector search uses `lib/vectorSearch.ts` helper for the shared embed → search → post-filter → topK pattern.
- **LangSmith sync**: Dataset sync is a separate action (`langsmith.sync.syncDataset`). Experiment sync happens natively during `evaluate()` — no separate sync step.
- **`"use node"` constraint**: Files with `"use node"` can ONLY contain actions. Mutations/queries must be in separate files. In the domain directories: `actions.ts` files have `"use node"`, `orchestration.ts`/other files do not.
- **`vectorSearch` constraint**: `ctx.vectorSearch()` is only available in actions, not queries. Pattern: vectorSearch in action → hydrate via internalQuery.
- **Sub-path isolation**: eval-lib's `/langsmith` and `/llm` sub-paths must only be imported from `"use node"` action files (they use Node.js-only dependencies like `openai`, `langsmith`). The `/shared` sub-path is safe for any file.
- **External packages**: `convex.json` marks `langsmith`, `@langchain/core`, and `openai` as external packages (not bundled by esbuild, installed on Convex server). Both `langsmith` and `@langchain/core` must be in `package.json` dependencies for the Convex bundler to resolve them correctly with pnpm.

### Frontend

- Convex reactive queries (`useQuery`/`useMutation`) for real-time UI updates
- Clerk handles authentication and organization switching via `AuthGate` component
- ConvexClientProvider with graceful fallback when Clerk/Convex not configured
- Design system: dark theme, JetBrains Mono, custom color tokens (accent: `#6ee7b7`)

### Testing

- eval-lib: 225 vitest tests covering strategies, ground-truth assigners, metrics, types, utilities, and sub-path modules (shared, llm, langsmith)
- backend: 46 convex-test integration tests covering generation callbacks, experiment callbacks, indexing callbacks, retriever CRUD, shared index protection, and workpool helpers
- Shared test helpers in `packages/backend/tests/helpers.ts` (setupTest, seedUser, seedKB, seedDataset, testIdentity)
- Mock LLM clients for testing strategies (return canned JSON responses)
